4. Click "Install"

### From VSIX
1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from releases
2. Open VS Code
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Install from VSIX"
4. Select the downloaded file


## üîß Usage

### Quick Start
1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "AI Rules Syncer: Generate AI Rules File"
3. Execute the command to create `ai-rules.md` and `ai-rules.config.yaml`
4. Edit your AI rules in `ai-rules.md`
5. Save the file - your rules are automatically synced to target files!

### Command Palette
- Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Type "Generate AI Rules File"
- Execute the command to set up your project

### Automatic Syncing
Once set up, the extension works automatically:
- Edit `ai-rules.md` (or your configured source file)
- Save the file (`Ctrl+S`)
- Extension syncs content to all target files defined in your config


## üìÅ File Organization

After running the "Generate AI Rules File" command, your project will have:

```text
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-rules.md                 # Your main AI rules file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-rules.config.yaml        # Configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                   # Synced copy for Claude
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cursor.md                   # Synced copy for Cursor
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursor/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules.md                # Synced copy in .cursor folder
```

### Configuration Structure

The `ai-rules.config.yaml` file controls the syncing behavior:

```yaml
# AI Rules Syncer Configuration
sourceFile: ai-rules.md

# Target files to sync to (supports folder paths)
targetFiles:
  - CLAUDE.md                    # Root directory file
  - cursor.md                    # Root directory file
  - .cursor/rules.md             # File in .cursor folder
  # - settings/.cursors/rules.md # Commented out (disabled)
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The extension uses a project-local YAML configuration file that supports comments.

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sourceFile` | string | `ai-rules.md` | The main AI rules file that triggers syncing when saved |
| `targetFiles` | array | `[CLAUDE.md, cursor.md, .cursor/rules.md]` | List of files to sync to (supports folder paths) |

### Editing Configuration

1. Open `ai-rules.config.yaml` in your project root
2. Edit the settings as needed
3. Use `#` to comment out target files you want to disable

### Folder Path Support

The extension supports creating files in nested directories:

```yaml
targetFiles:
  - CLAUDE.md                      # Root directory
  - .cursor/rules.md               # Single folder
  - settings/.cursors/rules.md     # Nested folders
  - docs/ai-guidelines.md          # Any folder structure
```

Folders are created automatically if they don't exist.

### Commenting Target Files

Enable/disable target files by commenting them out:

```yaml
targetFiles:
  - CLAUDE.md                      # Active
  - cursor.md                      # Active
  # - copilot.md                   # Disabled (commented out)
  - .cursor/rules.md               # Active
```

### Custom Source File

Change the source file that triggers syncing:

```yaml
sourceFile: my-custom-rules.md     # Instead of ai-rules.md
targetFiles:
  - CLAUDE.md
  - cursor.md
```
