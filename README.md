## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "AI Instructions Syncer"
4. Click "Install"

### From VSIX
1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from releases
2. Open VS Code
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Install from VSIX"
4. Select the downloaded file


## üîß Usage

### Quick Start
1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "AI Instructions Syncer: Generate AI Instructions File"
3. Execute the command to create `ai-rules.md` and `ai-rules.config.yaml`
4. Edit your AI rules in `ai-rules.md`
5. Save the file - your rules are automatically synced to target files!

### Available Commands
Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and use these commands:

- **"AI Instructions Syncer: Generate AI Instructions File"** - Create template files and configuration
- **"AI Instructions Syncer: Sync AI Instructions Now"** - Manually sync instructions to all target files

### Automatic Syncing
Once set up, the extension works automatically:
- Edit `ai-rules.md` (or your configured source file)
- Save the file (`Ctrl+S`)
- Extension syncs content to all target files defined in your config

### Manual Syncing
You can also sync manually or disable auto-sync:
- Use "AI Instructions Syncer: Sync AI Instructions Now" command
- Set `autoSync: false` in config to disable automatic syncing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The extension uses a project-local YAML configuration file that supports comments.

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sourceFile` | string | `ai-rules.md` | The main AI rules file that triggers syncing when saved |
| `targetFiles` | array | `[CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules]` | List of files to sync to (supports folder paths) |
| `autoSync` | boolean | `true` | Enable automatic syncing on save (set to false for manual sync only) |

### Editing Configuration

1. Open `ai-rules.config.yaml` in your project root
2. Edit the settings as needed
3. Use `#` to comment out target files you want to disable

### Folder Path Support

The extension supports creating files in nested directories:

```yaml
targetFiles:
  - CLAUDE.md                             # Claude Code
  - .cursorrules                          # Cursor IDE (legacy but still supported)
  - .github/copilot-instructions.md       # GitHub Copilot repository-wide instructions
  - .windsurf/rules/rules.md              # Windsurf rules directory
  - docs/ai-guidelines.md                 # Any custom folder structure
```

Folders are created automatically if they don't exist.

### Commenting Target Files

Enable/disable target files by commenting them out:

```yaml
targetFiles:
  - CLAUDE.md                             # Active - Claude Code
  - .cursorrules                          # Active - Cursor IDE
  # - .github/copilot-instructions.md     # Disabled (commented out)
  - .windsurf/rules/rules.md              # Active - Windsurf IDE
```

### Custom Source File

Change the source file that triggers syncing:

```yaml
sourceFile: my-custom-rules.md     # Instead of ai-rules.md
targetFiles:
  - CLAUDE.md
  - .cursorrules
autoSync: true                     # Enable automatic syncing (default)
```
